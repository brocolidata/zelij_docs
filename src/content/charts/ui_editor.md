description: Learn how to create charts with the UI in Zelij
---


The **UI Editor** in Zelij offers a simple, guided way to build charts without writing any code. Itâ€™s perfect for non-technical users or for quickly prototyping visualizations.

You can access the UI Editor when creating a chart tile in edit mode by switching to "UI Editor".

You should use the UI Editor when : 
* You're building standard charts (bar, line, area, pie, etc.).
* You prefer dropdowns over writing code.
* You want to iterate quickly or prototype dashboards.

The UI Editor helps you create charts by selecting options from dropdowns instead of writing SQL or JSON. Itâ€™s intuitive and flexible, and supports most common charting use cases.

# How It Works

The UI Editor is structured around 4 mandatory settings:

* **Dataset**:
  The table or data source that powers your chart. Selecting a dataset makes its columns available for use as dimensions or metrics. All chart logic is based on this data.

* **Dimensions**:
  Categorical fields used to group or segment dataâ€”typically mapped to the x-axis or used for series splitting. Examples include `year`, `region`, or `product_id`.

  * **Main dimension**: the primary axis of grouping
  * **Secondary dimension** *(optional)*: used to pivot data into multiple series

* **Metrics**:
  Numerical values to be aggregated and plottedâ€”typically shown on the y-axis. Examples include `sales`, `revenue`, or `conversion_rate`.

  * **Main metric**: the primary value being visualized
  * **Secondary metrics** *(optional)*: additional values that result in multiple chart series

* **Series**:
  The individual visual elements plotted on the chart (bars, lines, etc.). Each series maps a combination of dimensions and metrics to a specific chart type.

  * Automatically generated based on dimensions and metrics
  * Each series can have its own chart type

# Creation process

## 1. **Select a Dataset**

Choose the dataset that powers your chart. This can be:

* A predefined table or view
* A custom dataset youâ€™ve imported or created earlier

ðŸ“Œ *Once selected, Zelij loads available columns to use in the chart configuration.*

## 2. **Set the Main Dimension**

The main dimension is usually mapped to the **x-axis** and determines how data is grouped.

Examples:

* `year` â†’ to show change over time
* `region` â†’ to compare categories
* `product` â†’ to break down sales per item

## 3. **(Optional) Add a Secondary Dimension**

A secondary dimension allows you to **split the main dimension** into subgroups. This enables **pivoted charts**, such as:

* A line chart showing `sales` by `year`, split by `region`
* A bar chart showing `clicks` by `device`, split by `campaign`

Zelij automatically generates one **series per unique value** in the secondary dimension.

## 4. **Set the Main Metric**

The main metric is the primary **value** being measuredâ€”often shown on the **y-axis**.

Examples:

* `total_sales`
* `clicks`
* `revenue`

To set a metric, you select a **column** in the dataset and an aggregation (`sum`, `count`, `min`, `max`, ...).

## 5. **(Optional) Add Secondary Metrics**

Secondary metrics let you show **multiple values** for the same dimension. For example:

* Display both `sales` and `profit` by `year`
* Compare `conversions`, `impressions`, and `clicks` across campaigns

Each metric becomes its own **series** in the chart.

Like the main metric, secondary metrics are defined by selecting a **column** in the dataset and an aggregation (`sum`, `count`, `min`, `max`, ...).

## 6. Define Series
Series define how your data gets visualized on the chart.

For each series, you can:
- Select a metric or column.
- Choose a chart type (e.g., bar, line, area).


ðŸ’¡ You can auto-generate series based on your selections or define them manually.

# Supported Chart Scenarios

Zelij supports three key data visualization scenarios in the UI Editor:


## Main Dimension + Main Metric

This is the **simplest case**: one dimension and one metric.

Example:

* Dimension: `year`
* Metric: `total_sales`

**Result**: A single-series chart (e.g. a bar or line chart) showing total sales over time.

## 2 Dimensions + Main Metric

This creates a **pivoted chart**, where each series represents a value from the secondary dimension.

Example:

* Main Dimension: `year`
* Secondary Dimension: `region`
* Metric: `total_sales`

**Result**: A multi-series chart with one line or bar per region, grouped by year.


## Main Dimension + Multiple Metrics

This creates one series per metric, using the same dimension for grouping.

Example:

* Dimension: `year`
* Metrics: `sales`, `profit`, `expenses`

**Result**: A chart with three lines (or bars), each showing a different metric over time.

# ðŸ›  Tips & Notes

* You can **manually edit series** after they are generated to change chart type, color, or encoding.
* Use the **regenerate series** button if you update dimensions or metrics and want the chart to update automatically.
* You can **switch to the Advanced Editor** at any time to take full control over SQL and chart options.
